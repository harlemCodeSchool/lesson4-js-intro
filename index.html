  <h2>Lesson 4: Javascript Time</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Basic Javascript</h3>
    <p>As you know now, the main job of web browsers is to render 
       HTML pages, along CSS sheets to style them, and Javascript
       scripts to program both of these aspects. Lots of people use
       Javascript but it takes work to master.</p>
    <h4>Core Javascript</h4>
    <p>When building Javascript applications, you will be using the 
       language to construct and render your HTML and CSS rather than
       hardcoding everything on to the page. Here are the basics of 
       working with elements, some of the things you will come to use
       the most.   </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Targeting Elements</li>
        <p>You may have seen this before:</p>
        <code>var some_div = document.getElementById('someDiv');</code>
        <p>If not, you can probably guess that it is used to target an
           element by its 'id' attribute. </p>
      <li>Styling Elements</li>
        <p>You may also be familiar with how to style (with CSS via Javascript)
           an element. Here's how:</p>
        <code>var style_some_div = some_div.style.color = "blue";</code>
        <p>We can even make this code more reusabule by doing this: </p>
        <code>var style_some_div = some_div.style;
              style_some_div.color = "red";
              style_some_div.textDecoration = "underline";</code>
      <li>Creating Elements</li>
      <p>We can make new elements with JS with the document.createElement() function:</p>
      <code>var div1 = document.createElement('div');</code>
      <p>This code will create an empty div tag. We can style it:</p>
      <code>div1.style.color = "forestgreen";</code>
      <p>And we can add text inside.</p>
      <code>div1.innerHTML = "The boy bought the basketball."</code>
      <p><strong>Beware!</strong>the innerHTML() method will remove all 
        existing text and then add your text. This doesn't matter in our
        case though, since div1 just got created and never had any text to begin with!</p>
      <p>With document.createElement() we can actually create any type of element, even
         ones that do not exist. This is helpful when using XML or even Angular, which both
         rely on creating your own custom HTML tags. (As in not p tags, h1 tags, h2s, divs, etc.) Example:</p>
      <code>var span1 = document.createElement('span');
            span1.innertHTML = 'I am a span!';</code>
      <li>Appending Elements</li>
      <p>Now we know how to create and style new elements, here's how we add them to the page:</p>
      <code>document.appendChild(div1);</code>
      <p>That's it! Append, as you may know, adds something to the end of something else. 
         But what if we wanted to add something to the beginning of something? Javascript
         has you covered.</p>
      <code>document.insertBefore(span1, div1);</code>
      <p>The insertBefore method takes two arguments: one is the element you want 
         to insert, and the other is the item you want to insert it before. </p>
      <li>Putting It All Together</li>
      <p>We now know how to use Javascript to create and style elements, and then
         add them wherever we like to the web page. Now let's make a nice example of it.</p>
      <p>Let's make a signup sheet with JS:</p>
      <code>  var sign_up_form = function() {
                  // Create a container element
                  var sign_up_wrap = docment.createElement('span');
                  
                  // Style it
                  var suw_style = sign_up_wrap.style;`1

                  // Create the form
                  var form = document.createElement('form');

                  // Creat Name & Email Input
                  var name_input = document.createElement('input');
                  var email_input = document.createElement('input');

                  // Create Submit Button
                  var submit = document.createElement('input');



                  // Set name and email inputs to use text
                  name_input.type = "text";
                  email_input.type = "text";
                  submit.type = "submit";
                  

                  // Set name to name and email, respectively
                  name_input.name = "name";
                  email_input.name = "email";

                  // Set submit btn to Submit value on click
                  submit.value = "Submit";


                  // Put everything together:
                  form.append(name_input);
                  form.append(email_input);
                  form.append(submit);
                  
                  var sign_up_wrap.append(form);

                  document.appendChild(sign_up_wrap);




              } </code>
